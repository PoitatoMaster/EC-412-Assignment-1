### Done by: Shaurya Singh Rawat - 2K17/ME/214

**Problem Statement:** 
Model an independent signature verification task with a machine learning algorithm. In order to evaluate your signature verification algorithm, you should consider five widely used benchmark databases, viz., CEDAR, GPDS, MCYT-75, UTSig, and BHSig260 and also measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. 

For performing the signature verification task, Convolutional Neural Network are used.

The following are the results on various datasets:

**1. CEDAR Dataset**
The [CEDAR Dataset](https://cedar.buffalo.edu/NIJ/data/signatures.rar) gave the following results:

a. Accuracy:

b. Precision:

c. Recall:

d. F-Score:
