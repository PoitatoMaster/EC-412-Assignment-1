## Assignment - 1 : Signature Verification Model  
### Done by: Shaurya Singh Rawat - 2K17/ME/214

**Problem Statement:** 
Model an independent signature verification task with a machine learning algorithm. In order to evaluate your signature verification algorithm, you should consider five widely used benchmark databases, viz., CEDAR, GPDS, MCYT-75, UTSig, and BHSig260 and also measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. 

For performing the signature verification task, Convolutional Neural Networks are used.
