### Done by: Shaurya Singh Rawat - 2K17/ME/214

**Problem Statement:** 
Model an independent signature verification task with a machine learning algorithm. In order to evaluate your signature verification algorithm, you should consider five widely used benchmark databases, viz., CEDAR, GPDS, MCYT-75, UTSig, and BHSig260 and also measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. 

For performing the signature verification task, a Convolutional Neural Network are used.

The following are the results:


  **1. ICDAR 2011:**

 The [ICDAR 2011](https://www.kaggle.com/robinreni/signature-verification-dataset) gave the following results:

  a. Accuracy: 0.984

  b. Precision: 0.9836734693877551

  c. Recall: 0.9958677685950413

  d. F-Score: 0.9717741935483871
