## Assignment - 1 : Signature Verification Model  
### Done by: Shaurya Singh Rawat - 2K17/ME/214

**Problem Statement:** 
Model an independent signature verification task with a machine learning algorithm. In order to evaluate your signature verification algorithm, you should consider five widely used benchmark databases, viz., CEDAR, GPDS, MCYT-75, UTSig, and BHSig260 and also measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score. 

For performing the signature verification task, Convolutional Neural Network are used.

The following are the results on various datasets:

**1. CEDAR Dataset:**

 The [CEDAR Dataset](https://cedar.buffalo.edu/NIJ/data/signatures.rar) gave the following results:

  a. Accuracy:

  b. Precision:

  c. Recall:

  d. F-Score:
  
  

**2. BHSig260 Dataset:**

 The [BHSig260 Dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B29vNACcjvzVc1RfVkg5dUh2b1E/view) gave the following results:

  a. Accuracy:

  b. Precision:

  c. Recall:

  d. F-Score:
  
  
**3. UTSig Dataset:**

 The [UTSig Dataset](http://mlcm.ut.ac.ir/Datasets.html) gave the following results:

  a. Accuracy:

  b. Precision:

  c. Recall:

  d. F-Score:
  
  
  **4. ICDAR 2011:**

 The [ICDAR 2011](https://www.kaggle.com/robinreni/signature-verification-dataset) gave the following results:

  a. Accuracy:
